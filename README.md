# Leaflet Challenge
Using the Leaflet Javascript Library to Visualize  Weather AI

# Description
OpenWeatherMap (OWM) is a service providing weather related data, visualizing it using an OpenLayers based map. This is an independant Leaflet based script providing easy access to OWM's features for Leaflet based maps.
In short: An independant JavaScript library for including OWM's layers and OWM's current city data in Leaflet based maps.

# Demo
 [Live Data](https://hauhet.co/app/Weather/).
 Its "Wind Rose" overlay is an example of a user defined marker to give you an idea what can be achieved by user defined functions for markers. This map is available in the example directory, too.
